Q-1 : How many degrees of freedom does each joint have?
Ans : The degrees of freedom of each joint is depend on the type of joints for example the MCP joints 
      have two degrees of freedom and the other PIP and DIP joints have one degrees of freedom 
      and degrees of freedom about wrist is three.
      
Q-2 : Is there a way to compute the rotation matrices for each joint from their joint angles?
Ans : We can compute the rotation matrices for each joint through their joint angles which we calculated
      in the json file and by putting the angles value in the rotation matrix for 1 degree of freedom 
      [[cos(θ) sin(θ)] , [−sin(θ) cos(θ)]] and if the degree of freedom of joint is two then we have 
      to calculate rotation matrix individually for each direction x and y if and put the angles value
      in their formula and then multiply both the matrix to get the final rotation matrix and similarly 
      if degree of freedom is 3 then we have to calculate for each direction x, y, and z and put the 
      angles value in their respective formulas and multilply all the three matrices to get the final 
      roatation matrices.

Q-3 : How do we compute the length of each bone of the hand?
Ans : We can calculate the lenght of each bone(between two joints) using the euclidean diatance 
      formula by the coordinates of the joints ((x1-x2)^2 + (y1-y2)^2 + (z1-z2)^2)^0.5
